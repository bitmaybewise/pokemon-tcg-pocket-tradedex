## Development

How to prepare localhost for development?

This project is built using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Authentication and Firestore Database).

The emulators can be used for local development, but a dedicated project is recommended to simulate the environment it is deployed.

Copy the sample and fill the environment variable file with your Google Firebase project credentials:

```shell
$ cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

```shell
$ mise install

$ npm install

$ npm install -g firebase-tools

$ firebase login

$ firebase use tradedex-localhost

# deploy firebase rules
$ firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

$ npm run dev
```
